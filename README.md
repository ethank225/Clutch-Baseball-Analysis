Summary
Our project aims to analyze the concept of “Clutch Performance” within Major League Baseball, focusing exclusively on batting. We define clutch as an athlete’s change in win probability under pressure in game-critical moments. By dissecting these high-pressure situations, our project aims to unveil whether clutch performance is a myth or a reality, backed by statistical evidence. 

Key Areas of Investigation:

Existence and Consistency of Clutch Performance
Our primary goal is to determine if certain MLB players consistently outperform their usual metrics in clutch situations across multiple seasons. We aim to identify if these clutch performances can be statistically supported or if they are merely a random distribution of success. 
Measurement of Clutch Performance
The study will measure clutch performance in two distinct ways
Differential Approach: The difference between a player’s performance in clutch situations and their average performance
Win Probability Summation: The cumulative change in win probability for every at-bat in a clutch setting
Criteria for High Pressure Situations
Inning Threshold
We will narrow our focus to only performances in the 8th inning or later. By creating this parameter, we assume that the final innings of a game have a higher impact on the outcome, making the player's performance during this time more important.
Score Differential
The study will also only consider the moment where the score difference is two or less as key clutch situations. This criteria will help pinpoint the exact moments where a player’s performance has a heightened chance to alter the result of the game.
Strategic Value of Clutch Hitters
Beyond identifying the existence and consistency of clutch hitters, the project seeks to quantify their strategic value to an MLB team. The project aims to explore how crucial clutch hitters are to a team’s success and overarching strategy, potentially influencing managerial decisions, player selection, and game day tactics. 
The project will also explore the influence of team salaries on the total clutch rating, investigating whether financial investment in clutch players correlates to wins. 
Research Questions:
Can statistical evidence support the existence of consistent clutch performance among players across seasons?

Answer: Yes, the statistical evidence compiled through our project  supports the possibility of consistent clutch performance among players across multiple seasons. By analyzing data spanning several years, we observed enduring patterns of performance in clutch situations that some players repeatedly demonstrated.

Do certain MLB players consistently perform better in high-pressure situations, or is clutch performance randomly distributed?

Answer: Our research conclusively demonstrates that clutch performance is not a random distribution but rather a distinguishable trait exhibited by specific players over multiple seasons.

How critical are clutch hitters to the overall success and strategy of an MLB team?

Answer: After breaking down what players are consistently clutch in the MLB, we then merged our findings to see if clutch rating for a team truly affects their success and found that there is no correlation between the two variables.
